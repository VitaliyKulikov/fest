    <section name="Taking Screenshots of GUI Components">
      <p>
        FEST-Swing provides support for taking screenshots of specific GUI components. This feature may be handy in cases
        when we want to verify that custom drawing/painting is being made by our application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The class <code class="code">org.fest.swing.image.ScreenshotTaker</code> provides two methods for taking 
        screenshots of GUI components:
        <ol>
          <li>
            &quot;<code class="code">takeScreenshotOf(java.awt.Component)</code>&quot; takes a screenshot of the 
            given component and returns it as a <code class="code">java.awt.image.BufferedImage</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            &quot;<code class="code">saveComponentAsPng(java.awt.Component, String)</code>&quot; takes a screenshot of 
            the given component and saves it as a PNG image using the file path passed as argument.
          </li>
       </ol>
      </p>
      <subsection name="Comparing images">
        <p>
          To test that two images are equal, we can use the method 
          &quot;<code class="code">isEqualTo(java.awt.image.BufferedImage)</code>&quot; in 
          <code class="code">org.fest.assertion.ImageAssertion</code> (part of the 
          <a href="../assert/index.html">FEST-Assert</a> module.) This method verifies that two images have the same
          size and the color of each pixel is the same between the two images.
