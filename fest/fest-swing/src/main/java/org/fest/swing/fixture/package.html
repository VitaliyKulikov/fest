The power and flexibility of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fest/" target="_blank">FEST</a> come from the fixtures in
this package. Although you can use the <code>{@link org.fest.swing.RobotFixture}</code> directly, it is too low-level and
requires, in our opinion, too much code. FEST fixtures can simplify creation and maintenance of functional GUI tests by:
<ol>
<li>providing reliable lookup of GUI components (by component name or using custom criteria)</li>
<li>simulating user events on GUI components</li>
<li>providing assertion methods about the state of GUI components</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Each fixture has the name of the GUI component it can control plus the word &quot;Fixture&quot; at the end. For example, 
<code>{@link org.fest.swing.fixture.JButtonFixture}</code> can simulate user events on 
<code>{@link javax.swing.JButton}</code>s.
