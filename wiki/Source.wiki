===Old CodeHaus SVN repository===

  * Explore the source code [http://fisheye2.atlassian.com/browse/fest/ here].
  * Non-committer (anonymous) access is allowed over normal non-SSL WebDAV http://svn.codehaus.org/fest/trunk
  * Committer access over HTTPS + WebDAV is suitable for all users (including behind firewalls), although tends to be slower than SVN+SSH access: https://svn.codehaus.org/fest/

===Old Google Code SVN repository===

You can browse the old SVN repository (at Google Code) [http://code.google.com/p/fest/source/checkout here].
